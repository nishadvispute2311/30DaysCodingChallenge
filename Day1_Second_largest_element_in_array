Problem: Second Largest Element in array
Question: 
Given an array Arr of size N, print second largest distinct element from an array.

Example 1:
Input: 
N = 6
Arr[] = {12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1}
Output: 34

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function print2largest() which takes the array of integers arr and n as parameters and returns an integer denoting the answer. If 2nd largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 105

#CODE : 

class Solution:

	def print2largest(self,arr, n):
	    if n==1:
	        return -1
	    
	    lar=float('-inf')
	    slar=float('-inf')
	        
	    for i in range(n):
	        if arr[i]>lar:
	            slar=lar
	            lar=arr[i]
	        elif arr[i]>slar and arr[i]<lar:
	            slar=arr[i]
	    if slar>float('-inf'):
	        return slar
	    else:
	        return -1
